# "Reset Test Setup…" — a TEST-CHANNEL-ONLY menu action that wipes this build's
# whole slate (backend stack + data volume, state dir, credentials, app setup)
# and relaunches into onboarding, so the initial setup flow can be exercised
# again from scratch. The load-bearing contract is that it can NEVER touch a
# production install: it is hidden on stable, guarded in code, and every target
# is a test-channel resource. These assertions pin that source contract.
