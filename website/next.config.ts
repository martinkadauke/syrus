// Static export for GitHub Pages: `next build` emits a fully static site to

//   - No server: API routes, `force-dynamic`, and custom headers are gone.
//     Pages can't set response headers, so the old CSP/security headers (which
//     lived on the previous self-hosted server) are dropped here. Pages serves
//     HTTPS with HSTS on custom domains automatically.
//   - Image Optimization needs a server, so images are served unoptimized.
//   - trailingSlash keeps every route as `dir/index.html`, which Pages serves
//     reliably at `/dir/` (and 301s `/dir` → `/dir/`).
